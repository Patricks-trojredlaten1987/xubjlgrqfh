just walked out, thoughts swirling — like a blender of squirrels, chaos and fur and squeaky chatter in my head. Revelations... was it? recommended by Jenny I think, she said to download the movie if life's meaning needed a reboot. popcorn crumbs are everywhere, couch or bed maintenance fund needed asap. 

the opening scene, that blinding white light, it’s still seared into my retinas. half imagined, half remembered — like a dream where you can't scream, just whispers. faces blurred but emotions too sharp: despair, hope, love, all crammed into a split second. kinda like waiting in line at Starbucks with a hangover... every second expands like a universe.

> the scene with the dog, when it morphed into the grandmother — bizarre and touching, like those old cartoons where everything has eyes and a sense of responsibility. some guys behind me were loudly debating if it was symbolism or just a director's quirk. I think I got popcorn in my shoe somehow. 

and the ending! explosive yet intimate, a firework inside a jar. I was half expecting someone to stand up and propose — it had that heady mix of romance and unpredictability. Tension like when you’re late for something important but still decide to stop for a donut. personally think they stretched that time reversal scene a bit too long, narrative seemed to lose its pants. 

oh and someone was singing in the corridor — did that make it surreal or am I just overtired? should definitely watch the movie again, maybe on a Tuesday morning where reality feels adjustable. aching back needs yoga I guess, but who's got the time when you're stuck contemplating existential cinema? 

Character arcs, almost fractal in complexity, overlapping like too many transparent layers. I'm not even sure if I'm making sense. Feel like I could spend a lifetime unraveling it, or just feed it to the pigeons nibbling the leftover kernels at my feet. 

int main() {
cout {unexpected token on line 42}; // who let this code in here?
return existential_crisis;
}
